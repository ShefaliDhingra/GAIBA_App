**Artificially Intelligent Resume Refinement Assistant**

AIRRA is a demo project built with Streamlit that helps candidates evaluate how well their resumes align with a given job description and role.  

The app compares resume text with job description text, highlights matching keywords, identifies skill gaps, and provides a simple classification of **Current Resume Strength** (No Match, Low, Medium, High).  

This project was developed as a professional demo to showcase how **AI and NLP** can be used to support resume refinement and job matching.
